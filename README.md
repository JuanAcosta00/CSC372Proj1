# LANGUAGE:     PHP

# You need to install PHP on your computer to run it. 
1. Go to php.net and download the package according to your local machine. Then extract them into a folder and put them in where ever you like in the computer, assume you put it directly under your C drive, so the address of your php folder is: C:\php
2. Then configure your window path variable. Go to Edit the system environment variables -> Advanced -> Enviornment Variables... -> Click on Path in the User variables for "Your user name" and hit Edit -> NEW -> enter C:\php or whatever your php folder located -> OK -> OK -> OK. 
# You'll also need XAMPP Apache to open php web page on your local machine. I'm on window for the reference. 
1. Go to https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html and download according to your machine, then install. 
2. Put this repository under htdocs folder in xampp folder. 
3. Then you can just open XAMPP and Start the Apache. I changed the main port and SSL port but not sure if that's necessary. Reference to this video as tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG1SJGYYbTk. 
3. Assume your main port is 8080. Then just go to http://localhost:8080/CSC372Proj1/client/dist/index.php and you should see the website.
